    <h4>Do we use 'cookies'? </h4> 
                 <p> Yes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your  computer's hard drive through your Web browser (if you allow) that enables   the site's or service provider's systems to recognize your browser and   capture and remember certain information. For instance, we use cookies to    help us remember and process the items in your shopping cart. They are  also used to help us understand your preferences based on previous or  current site activity, which enables us to provide you with improved services.   We also use cookies to help us compile aggregate data about site traffic and  site interaction so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the  future. </p>
                  
                   <p>We use cookies to: </p>

                    <li>  Keep track of advertisements. </li>
                    </ol>

                  <h4>California Online Privacy Protection Act </h4> 
                  <p>CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites   and online services to post a privacy policy. The law's reach stretches well   beyond California to require a person or company in the United States (and   conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting personally   identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous  privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected   and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this  policy. - See more at:</p>                   
                   <p><a href="http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf">http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf</a> </p> 
                 <p> According to CalOPPA we agree to the following:</p> 
                 <ol>
                 <li>
                 Users can visit our site anonymously Once this privacy policy is created,   we will add a link to it on our home page, or as a minimum on the first  significant page after entering our website. Our Privacy Policy link  includes the word 'Privacy', and can be easily be found on the page  specified above.  
                 </li>
                 <li>
                    Users will be notified of any privacy policy changes by email if they  allowed receiving emails from our service. 
                 </li>
                 <li>
                   On our Privacy Policy Page Users are able to change their personal information by emailing us.
                 </li>
                 </ol>
                 
                  <p>How does our site handle do not track signals? We honor do not track signals  and do not track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track (DNT) browser mechanism is in place.</p>  
                <p></p>  Does our site allow third party behavioral tracking? It's also important to note that we do not allow third party behavioral tracking 
                  
                    <h4>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</h4> 
                  <p>When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under   13, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in    control. The Federal Trade Commission, the nation's consumer protection   agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of  websites and online services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online.</p>  
                  <p>We do not specifically market to children under 13.</p>
                  
                  <h4>Fair Information Practices  </h4>
                  <p>The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in  the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding  the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented  is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal  information.</p>  
                  <p>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following  responsive action, should a data breach occur:  </p>
                 <ol>
                 <li>Within 7 business days we will notify the users via our system site notification 
                 </li>
                 </ol>
                 
                 <p> We also agree to the individual redress principle, which requires that  individuals have a right to pursue legally enforceable rights against data  collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle  requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users,  but also that individuals have recourse to courts or a government agency to   investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors. </p>
                  
                  <h4></h4> CAN SPAM Act
                   
                   <p>The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email,   establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right   to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough   penalties for violations. </p> 
                   
                  <p>We collect your email address in order to send information, respond to   inquiries, and/or other requests or questions. </p>
                  
                  <p>  To be in accordance with CANSPAM we agree to the following: </p>
                  
                  <ol>
